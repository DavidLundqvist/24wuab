                        <h2>Hand</h2>
                        <p>
                            The hand is the first part of the arm. Inside the forearm, there are 6 motors. 5 to control each individual
                            finger, and one to rotate the wrist. The finger motors work by tugging a string which is attatched to the 
                            inside of the finger top. You can see this with the thumb where the finger top is currently removed. By
                            pulling the string, the finger will curl up and when released it will unflex. The motor pulls and releases
                            the string in order to flex the finger. One motor is for one finger so each finger can be controlled individually.
                            <br><br> The wrist motor is a simple gear which moves a bigger gear, which the whole hand is attatched to resulting
                            in the wrist being able to turn. The motors in the fingers are MG996r servos, while the wrist is a micro servo.
                            The mechanism can be seen peeking out in the hoels in the forearm. The holes are due to design and CADing errors.
                            <br><br> At the base of the forearm, all wires from the motors are exserted. The wires are then put in the back of he 
                            bicep and go up to the electronic circuit board. The forearm has 2 places to attatch to the bicep. One is the point of
                            rotation, while the other is to actually pull the forearm up. This is more thorrowly explained in the next section.

                        <h2>Bicep</h2>
                        <p>
                            The bicep is the second piece to the arm. Its funtion is to pull the forearm up and down to recemble a bicep and to twist
                            the whole arm to face any direction. The bicep has 2 motors to complete this. One MG996r servo motor which can be seen inside 
                            the bicep, and the other servo is a micro servo which is at the top of the bicep (on the left of the picture). <br><br> The 
                            bicep works by having the motor attached to a worm gear which when activated pulls the motor up towards it by screwing in the 
                            worm gear. The bottom of the motor is attached to a hole on the forearm. This motion pulls the forarm upwards. <br><br> Like 
                            the wrist movement, the turning of the whole arm works with the same principle. The bicep is attached to a gear with a worm gear
                            as driver gear. When it turns, the bicep and then whole arm turns with it. Over this mechanism is where the shoulder sits. Its 
                            attached to the bicep simply with pegs you could say.

                        <h2>Shoulder</h2>
                        <p>
                            The shoulder is the third piece of the arm and the last of the actual arm. It is the most complex and constraining part of the arm.
                            The shoulder is like a hinge, alloing the whole arm to move outwards from where the body would have been. The hinge is then attached
                            to a surface which can turn allowing it to go forward. In the hinge and the surface plate are 2 NEVA 17 stepper motors. <br><br>
                            The motors are in cylinders with 2 planitary gears in series with a 3:1 ratio meaning to spin the last piece one rotation, the motor 
                            would have to spin 9 times! This helps give more torque to the motor and allow it to lift the weight of the arm. The end of the last planitary
                            gear is attached to the hinge making it move, and the surface plate making it also move. <br><br> The cylinders are stationary while 
                            everything else aroudn them rotates. They are the pivot of rotation for each axis. The surface plate is secured to a table or surface. 
                            This completes all the parts of the arm, but all the motors have to be controlled form somewhere and get energy somewhere too. This is where
                            the electronics come in.

                        <h2>Electronics</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is the brain of the arm, this is where all inputs are handled and the controlling of each and every motor. The method of
                            controlling the arm which i have chosen is by using an arduino uno wifi r3. It is like a rasbery pie, but more powerful and can
                            easier to work with. This, along with the breadbord to the right of it, help connect all motors to one place. <br><br> Each motor has 
                            a power cord, a ground cord, and a signal cord. All power cords are connected to one side of the breadboard, while all the ground cords
                            are to the other side. The signal cord is attached to the arduino. In this case, the arduino only provides the signal and input for the 
                            motors, but not the actual power. <br><br> The power for the motors is gotten using a micro HDMI charger plugged into the wall. The micro 
                            HDMI is split into its positive and ground cables which are attached to each respective side of the breadboard. This gives the motors power. 
                            The arduino gets power from the computer which is the GUI for the controls.
