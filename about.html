                    <p>
                        ACRA is a 3d printed robotic arm which is controlled using an arduino and servo motors. It is a side
                        project which i have been working on for the better part of a year now. I first got the idea to build an
                        arm in the summer of 2023, and at the beginning of the new school year, I began building it. <br><br> It is 
                        composed of 4 parts. Those being the hand, bicep, shoulder and electronics. More can be read about those in the
                         <b>Mechanisms</b> tab.

                <h1 class="aboutHeading">What is its purpose</h1>
                <div class="about">
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the project was to develop my skills in CADing, constructing, applied physics, wiring and
                        problem solving. Together with that, it has always been a dream of mine to create something like this. I 
                        am very curious when it comes to prosthetics and this is the first step in my mind. <br><br> However,
                        another big reason to why i am bulding this is to compete in NTI awards 2024 for best makerspace creation
                        and i believe this has a chance of winning. I have a lot more planned with this arm, but for this year I am
                        content with only competing with the hand and bicep movement.

                <h1 class="aboutHeading">Functions and limitations</h1>
                <div class="about">
                    <p>
                        ACRA has a broad range of functions. It has the ability to flex each finger seperatly and at various amounts.
                        This means that the hand can make and hand gester that the user desigers. To some degree, you could make it
                        sign sign language <br><br> However, it does have its limitations. In the wrist for example, it can spin, but not
                        bend forward or backward. So, some movement in the wrist are lost due to this. The fingers can also only go open, 
                        closed or something inbetween, but cannot wiggle or shake side to side. This was done due to being too complex for me to do.
