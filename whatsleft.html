                The ACRA project however, is not complete and have improvements and functions yet to be fixed. Here is the list of them.

                <h2>Extra shoulder support</h2>
                <p>
                    Current weight is too much. Either reduce the weight in the forearm/bicep by 
                    redesigning, or with the use of a counter weight. Another improvement would be to
                    add more structure between the hinge and surface place so that they are more connected.
                </p>

            <section class="whatsLeftSection">
                <h2>Control with controller</h2>
                <p> 
                    Make the way to control the arm by using a controller instead of inputs in terminal on computer.
                    It will make it easier to learn and for others to try out. Together with that allow for easier transportation.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="whatsLeftSection">
                <h2>Speakers</h2>
                <p>
                    Speakers will hopefully be added to it to allow audio to be sent when specific gesters or inputs are made. 
                    Would also be pretty funny.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="whatsLeftSection">
                <h2>Control using EMG</h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, after controlling with controller. The next step is making it be able to be controlled using 
                    your own very arm. EMG pads will sense what muscle you are using and perform the corrosponding one for the 
                    arm. This would make it basically a mirror of your arm.
                </p>

            <section class="whatsLeftSection">
                <h2>Combine shoulder and arm</h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, the shoulder and arm are not connected and cannot run at the same time. This is due to time constraints,
                    but hopefully when i have shaved off weight of it. I can combine them so that the whole arm is in one and controllable.
